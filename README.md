🚀 Professional Web Development Portfolio
Internship Task 4: Multi-Page Responsive Website
This repository contains a fully functional, three-page website developed as part of my web development internship. The project demonstrates a transition from basic HTML to a scalable, professional architecture.

📁 Project Structure
Following professional best practices for scalability, the project is organized into a clean directory system:

Root: Contains home.html, about.html, and contact.html.

/css: Contains style.css to manage global styles across all pages.

🛠️ Key Technical Features
Multi-Page Navigation: Implemented a consistent navigation bar and footer across all pages using relative paths.

Active Link Highlighting: Used CSS classes to provide visual feedback, indicating which page is currently active in the navigation menu.

Flexbox Layouts: Built a responsive "Home" page hero section and feature cards using display: flex and flex-wrap.

CSS Box Model: Applied precise control over margins, padding, and borders to create professional "card" components.

Semantic HTML5: Used descriptive tags like <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> for better accessibility and SEO.

Responsive Design: The site is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience from mobile to desktop.
